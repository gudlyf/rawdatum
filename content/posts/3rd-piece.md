# The Cloud-Agnostic Argument
If you’ve already been running your production environment in the cloud for, say, the past five-plus years or so, you’re probably feeling pretty happy right where you are -- or, at least, pretty comfortable. And let’s say you’ve migrated your non-cloud app and its infrastructure over to this cloud provider, as-is: simple VMs, maybe a load balancer. Then, over the years, you’ve matured this environment to take advantage of what this cloud provider has to offer: object storage, caching, auto-scaling, managed databases. Then functions. Then some other new managed service no one else seems to be able to replicate as well. Your production is all humming away beautifully, with fewer things to manage, and all under one roof (provider-wise, that is).

Now, you’d better be comfortable with your cloud provider, because you’re pretty well stuck.
