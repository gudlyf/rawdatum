title: "6th Piece: I bet being cloud agnostic is sounding good to GCP users right about now"

Some news came out yesterday — or, in Google's eyes, an inaccurate rumor — about Google's five-year (now three-year) plan to be the Number One cloud provider by 2023, beating out both AWS and Azure. [From what was mentioned](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/google-reportedly-set-ambitious-goal-and-possible-deadline-for-gcp), execs inside Google at one point discussed the idea of just up and scrapping the whole cloud business altogether! In the end, they decided they'd give it until 2023 to be at the top of the cloud provider list, or ... ?

Let's face it: Google's track record for taking their products and services behind the wood shed to be shot is disturbingly sound. Them deciding GCP is yet another "thing" they're going to terminate isn't entirely unfathomable. If they're not in the top slot come 2023, it stands to reason they'd consider exiting the space. Who want's to be number three, right?

So where does that leave the customers who are using GCP? Most apropos to this post: what happens to those who've gone all-in with GCP — those who threw out the idea of being cloud agnostic? Of dealing with the uncertain future in accepting vendor lock-in?

I guess ... "ooops?"

Even if this news is a little true, it's not going to help further adoption of GCP, nor their rise to the top of that list. As someone else put it: "Why would you go to GCP when they're just going to rage quit the space in a few years?"

I'll say it again, folks: There's always time to at least discuss the pros and cons — and likelihood, however remote — of [the cloud agnostic argument](https://rawdatum.com/posts/3rd-piece/).
